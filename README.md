## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sam and I am a junior CS student at Washington and Lee University.

Outside of class, I enjoy being outside, running, working out, playing the guitar, playing soccer, and spending time with my friends.

In the classroom, I am interested in learning more about developing and becoming comfrotable with industry tools such as Github.
